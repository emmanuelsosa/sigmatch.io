# sigmatch_io -- Your Software Engineering social media platform

Teaching and learning technologies is a topic of matter for any computer engineer nowadays. Sometimes it is not so easy to understand certain tech-related topics or simply someone does not know where to start when it comes to searching for help, in spite of all the courses and classes being offered. 

Most people try to learn by themselves resulting in an incomplete comprehension of technologies and that could become something really frustrating.
On the other hand, there are persons that could share their knowledge but do not always have the initiative or find attractive incentives to search for a space to teach or even socialize due to the compromise that this could represent.
